Name rules (for all names)
--------------------------

    Use no abbreviations other than those mentioned above, and always
    use those abbreviations.

    Use Depth, never Z.

Procedure name rules
--------------------

    Limit procedure names to 2 words, 3 for procedures that return state.

    Never use set, as in SetFeedbackBuffer.

    Begin each word with a capital letter, except the second word of
    compound words.

    Use Verb-noun (DeleteList) and adjective-noun (EdgeFlag) formats.

Definition name rules
---------------------

    Use all capital letters.

    Separate words with underbars, except words within compound words.

    Append simple numeric suffixes directly to the end of definition
    tokens (LIGHT0).  Begin these sequences with 0.

    Use an underbar to separate complex suffixes from the token body
    (MAP_3V).

Parameter name rules
--------------------

    <target> is reserved for the notion of "which is affected", and for
    the corresponding "which is returned" get commands.

    <params> is reserved for an array of parameters whose contents are
    defined by a second enumerated argument, called <pname>.

    Begin number sequences with 1, not 0.  (e.g. u1,u2, not u0,u1)

Parameter order
---------------

    X preceeds Y preceeds Z preceeds W.

    R preceeds B preceeds B preceeds A.

    The array being passed is always the last argument.

    If a passed array has a type, the type specification argument immediately
    precedes the array.

    <pname> always preceeds <params>.

    x and y preceed width and height

    format preceeds type

    target is first

    face is first

Suffix codes
------------

    i		signed 32-bit integer
    ui		unsigned 32-bit integer
    s		signed 16-bit integer
    us		unsigned 16-bit integer
    b		signed 8-bit integer
    ub		unsigned 8-bit integer
    f		32-bit float
    d		64-bit float
    l		logical
    v		vector format
